Video & Audio Muxer is an add-on that helps you easily mux video-only and audio-only files and generate a video file with embedded audio in your browser.

It uses the FFmpeg library which is compiled from C and C++ language to JavaScript with the Emscripten project. Emscripten is a source-to-source compiler that can compile native C/C++ codes to JavaScript language. To work with this add-on, just open the app UI and drag input files (video & audio) in the app UI. Then, press on the - Command - button to insert the mux command and finally press on the - Mux - button to start the job. Once the muxing is done, a preview for the resulting video will be shown and a - Download - button will also appear.

Note 1: if you are familiar with FFmpeg commands, you can enter your mux command in the input field. The - Command - button in the app only inserts a common mux command.

Note 2: the default extension for the output video is set similar to the input video file. You can change this file extension, but please enter a proper FFmpeg command to change the final file extension, otherwise, the FFmpeg engine will not be able to mux the inputs for the chosen output file extension.

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
