This addon is using the compiled version of FFmpeg library using Emscripten.

The compiled - ffmpeg-all-codecs.js - file is very large (around 26MB).
Therefore, it is broken in to smaller pieces and then included in to the addon's package.

The original - ffmpeg-all-codecs.js - file can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/bgrins/videoconverter.js/blob/master/build/ffmpeg-all-codecs.js

Then, it is broken in to multiple files with the following Linux command:
split --bytes=3M --numeric=1 ffmpeg-all-codecs.js ffmpeg-all-codecs.part
